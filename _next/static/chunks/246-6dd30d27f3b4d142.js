Ultiracer is designed to be accessible for all ages and fitness levels. The balance training is particularly beneficial for seniors as it helps maintain stability, reduce fall risk, and preserve cognitive function. Our guides can customize programs to match your current abilities and health goals. The platform provides a safe, controlled environment for building strength and coordination at your own pace."},{question:"Do I need cycling experience?",answer:"No prior cycling experience is required. While the RDT platform is unique in requiring active steering and balance, our guides will help you get started at a comfortable level. Beginners start with basic sessions that focus on building familiarity with the equipment and developing fundamental balance skills. The platform adapts to your skill level, making it suitable whether you're new to cycling or an experienced rider."},{question:"What fitness level do I need?",answer:"Ultiracer accommodates all fitness levels, from beginners to advanced athletes. Our personalized programs are designed to meet you where you are. You can start with low-intensity sessions focused on balance awareness and gradually progress to more challenging workouts. The key is consistency, not starting fitness level. Your guide will help design a program that matches your current abilities and goals."}]},{category:"How It Works",questions:[{question:"How does balance tracking work?",answer:"Ultiracer uses precision sensors to track your lateral (left-right) position in real-time during cycling. The system captures your body position at 100Hz, detecting subtle shifts and movement patterns. This data is displayed live on your screen, showing the percentage of time you spend on the left vs. right side. Over sessions, you can see your balance symmetry improve. The high-precision 9-axis motion sensor provides detailed orientation and movement data at 100Hz."},{question:"What makes Ultiracer different from regular stationary bikes?",answer:"Traditional stationary bikes have fixed handlebars and no lateral movement—you simply pedal in place. Ultiracer requires active steering and allows lateral balance shifts, engaging core muscles and spatial awareness that fixed bikes cannot activate. The real-time left-right position tracking provides unique feedback on movement symmetry. This combination creates a brain-body training experience focused on balance, coordination, and cognitive engagement beyond basic cardio."},{question:"What data does the platform track?",answer:"The platform tracks multiple metrics: left-right position balance (percentage distribution), heart rate and zones, session duration, steering patterns, balance score over time, and detailed IMU data including quaternion orientation, acceleration, and angular velocity at 100Hz. All data is visualized in your dashboard where you can see session-by-session progress, trends, and improvements in balance symmetry and performance."}]},{category:"Health & Safety",questions:[{question:"Is this a medical device?",answer:"No, the RDT platform is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. We do not make therapeutic claims. The platform is designed for fitness and wellness, with benefits supported by general peer-reviewed research on cycling, balance training, and brain health. While the cognitive and physical benefits are real and research-backed, this is a wellness tool, not a medical treatment. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program."},{question:"Are there any health restrictions?",answer:"As with any exercise program, you should consult your doctor before beginning, especially if you have cardiovascular conditions, balance disorders, recent injuries, neurological conditions, or are pregnant. RDT is generally safe, but individual health situations vary. Your healthcare provider can help determine if balance-focused cycling is appropriate for you. Our guides will work within any limitations you and your doctor establish."},{question:"Is it safe for balance-impaired individuals?",answer:"Ultiracer is stable and designed with safety in mind—it will not tip over. However, individuals with significant balance impairments should consult their healthcare provider first. For those cleared to participate, the controlled environment actually provides a safe way to practice balance challenges. The lateral movement is limited and controlled, and you can start with minimal steering requirements. Many users find that consistent training helps improve their real-world balance over time."}]},{category:"Training & Programs",questions:[{question:"What are Neurocycleans?",answer:"Neurocycleans are members of the RDT community—people committed to brain-body balance training and cognitive wellness through our unique cycling platform. The name reflects our focus on the connection between neural (brain) health and cycling. As a Neurocyclean, you're part of a community pursuing sharper minds, better balance, and improved overall wellness through scientifically-informed training."},{question:"How often should I train?",answer:"For optimal results, we recommend 3-4 sessions per week, with each session lasting 20-45 minutes depending on your program. Consistency is more important than intensity—regular moderate training produces better long-term benefits than sporadic intense sessions. Your guide will design a schedule that fits your goals, fitness level, and lifestyle. Many Neurocycleans start with 2-3 sessions weekly and increase as they build endurance and see results."},{question:"How long until I see results?",answer:"Many users report increased body awareness and improved balance feedback within 2-3 weeks of consistent training. Measurable improvements in balance symmetry typically appear within 4-6 weeks. Cognitive benefits like improved focus and mental clarity often become noticeable around the same timeframe. Physical improvements in core strength and endurance develop progressively over 6-12 weeks. Remember that everyone progresses differently—your dashboard will track your individual improvements."},{question:"Can I train on my own or do I need a guide?",answer:"You have both options. Many users work with a guide who designs personalized programs, monitors progress, and provides accountability and expertise. Guides help optimize your training and ensure you're challenging yourself appropriately. However, you can also access pre-designed programs and free-ride modes independently. The platform provides all the data and feedback you need to train effectively on your own if you prefer."}]},{category:"Equipment & Access",questions:[{question:"Can I use my own bike?",answer:"Yes, if you purchased your own Ultiracer unit for personal use, you may attach your own bike. However, Ultiracer units installed at facilities may come with preconfigured instrumentation, so we recommend asking the facility directly about their bike policy."},{question:"Where can I access an Ultiracer?",answer:"Ultiracer is currently available at select partner facilities and studios. When you sign up, you'll be connected with locations near you that have the platform installed. Some Neurocycleans have access to private RDT setups. Contact us for information about locations in your area or opportunities to bring RDT to your facility or community."},{question:"Do I need any additional equipment?",answer:"The basic RDT platform includes everything you need for balance tracking and training. We recommend a heart rate monitor (chest strap or armband) for accurate heart rate zone tracking, though this is optional. Comfortable cycling attire and athletic shoes are sufficient—you don't need special cycling shoes or clipless pedals. Water bottle and towel are recommended for hydration and comfort during sessions."}]}],quickStats:{title:"Ultiracer by the Numbers",subtitle:"Key facts about our platform and community",items:[{value:"100 Hz",label:"Sensor Sampling Rate"},{value:"All Ages",label:"Suitable For"},{value:"3-4x",label:"Sessions Per Week"},{value:"20-45",label:"Minutes Per Session"}]},stillHaveQuestions:{title:"Still Have Questions?",subtitle:"We're here to help!

RDT는 일반적으로 안전하지만 개인의 건강 상황은 다릅니다. 의료 제공자가 균형 중심 사이클링이 적합한지 판단하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 가이드는 귀하와 의사가 설정한 제한 사항 내에서 진행합니다."},{question:"균형 장애가 있는 사람에게 안전한가요?",answer:"Ultiracer는 안정적이며 안전을 고려하여 설계되어 넘어지지 않습니다. 그러나 심각한 균형 장애가 있는 분은 먼저 의료 제공자와 상담해야 합니다. 참여가 승인된 분들에게는 통제된 환경이 실제로 균형 챌린지를 안전하게 연습할 수 있는 방법을 제공합니다. 좌우 이동은 제한적이고 통제되며, 최소한의 조향 요구 사항으로 시작할 수 있습니다. 많은 사용자들이 꾸준한 훈련이 실생활 균형 개선에 도움이 된다고 보고합니다."}]},{category:"트레이닝 및 프로그램",questions:[{question:"뉴로사이클리언이란 무엇인가요?",answer:"뉴로사이클리언은 독특한 사이클링 플랫폼을 통해 뇌-신체 균형 트레이닝과 인지 웰니스에 전념하는 RDT 커뮤니티의 구성원입니다. 이 이름은 신경(뇌) 건강과 사이클링 사이의 연결에 대한 우리의 초점을 반영합니다. 뉴로사이클리언으로서, 과학적으로 뒷받침된 트레이닝을 통해 더 명료한 정신, 더 나은 균형, 향상된 전반적 웰니스를 추구하는 커뮤니티의 일원이 됩니다."},{question:"얼마나 자주 훈련해야 하나요?",answer:"최적의 결과를 위해 주 3-4회 세션을 권장하며, 각 세션은 프로그램에 따라 20-45분입니다. 강도보다 꾸준함이 더 중요합니다. 규칙적인 중간 강도 훈련이 산발적인 고강도 세션보다 더 나은 장기적 효과를 가져옵니다. 가이드가 목표, 체력 수준, 라이프스타일에 맞는 일정을 설계해 드립니다. 많은 뉴로사이클리언이 주 2-3회로 시작하여 체력이 붙고 결과를 보면서 늘려갑니다."},{question:"결과를 보기까지 얼마나 걸리나요?",answer:"많은 사용자들이 2-3주의 꾸준한 훈련 후 신체 인식 향상과 균형 피드백 개선을 보고합니다. 균형 대칭성의 측정 가능한 개선은 보통 4-6주 내에 나타납니다. 집중력과 정신적 명료함 같은 인지적 효과도 비슷한 시기에 눈에 띄게 됩니다. 코어 근력과 지구력의 신체적 향상은 6-12주에 걸쳐 점진적으로 발전합니다. 모든 사람의 진도가 다르다는 것을 기억하세요. 대시보드에서 개인별 향상을 추적할 수 있습니다."},{question:"혼자 훈련할 수 있나요, 아니면 가이드가 필요한가요?",answer:"두 가지 옵션 모두 가능합니다. 많은 사용자들이 맞춤 프로그램을 설계하고 진도를 모니터링하며 책임감과 전문성을 제공하는 가이드와 함께합니다. 가이드는 트레이닝을 최적화하고 적절한 수준의 도전을 보장합니다. 그러나 사전 설계된 프로그램과 자유 라이딩 모드를 독립적으로 이용할 수도 있습니다. 플랫폼은 혼자 효과적으로 훈련하는 데 필요한 모든 데이터와 피드백을 제공합니다."}]},{category:"장비 및 이용",questions:[{question:"개인 자전거를 사용할 수 있나요?",answer:"네, 개인용으로 Ultiracer를 구매하신 경우 자신의 자전거를 장착할 수 있습니다. 다만, 시설에 설치된 Ultiracer는 사전 구성된 계측 장비가 포함되어 있을 수 있으므로, 해당 시설에 직접 자전거 정책을 문의하시는 것을 권장합니다."},{question:"Ultiracer는 어디서 이용할 수 있나요?",answer:"Ultiracer는 현재 선별된 파트너 시설과 스튜디오에서 이용 가능합니다. 가입 시 플랫폼이 설치된 근처 위치와 연결됩니다. 일부 뉴로사이클리언은 개인 RDT 설비를 이용합니다. 해당 지역의 위치 정보나 시설 또는 커뮤니티에 RDT를 도입할 기회에 대해서는 문의해 주세요."},{question:"추가 장비가 필요한가요?",answer:"기본 RDT 플랫폼에는 균형 추적과 훈련에 필요한 모든 것이 포함되어 있습니다. 정확한 심박수 존 추적을 위해 심박수 모니터(가슴 스트랩 또는 암밴드)를 권장하지만 필수는 아닙니다. 편안한 사이클링 복장과 운동화면 충분하며, 특수 사이클링 신발이나 클릿 페달은 필요하지 않습니다. 세션 중 수분 보충과 편안함을 위해 물병과 수건을 준비하시기를 권장합니다."}]}],quickStats:{title:"숫자로 보는 Ultiracer",subtitle:"플랫폼과 커뮤니티에 대한 주요 사실",items:[{value:"100 Hz",label:"센서 샘플링 속도"},{value:"전 연령",label:"대상"},{value:"주 3-4회",label:"권장 세션"},{value:"20-45",label:"세션당 분"}]},stillHaveQuestions:{title:"아직 궁금한 점이 있으신가요?",subtitle:"도움을 드리겠습니다! 팀에 문의하거나 Ultiracer가 어떻게 웰니스 목표를 지원할 수 있는지 전화 상담을 예약하세요.",primaryButton:"지금 시작하기",secondaryButton:"고객 지원 문의"},learnMore:{title:"더 알아보기",subtitle:"Ultiracer 플랫폼을 이해하기 위한 추가 리소스를 탐색하세요",resources:[{title:"과학적 근거",description:"뇌-신체 균형 트레이닝 뒤에 있는 동료 심사 연구를 확인하세요.",linkText:"자세히 보기"},{title:"효과",description:"Ultiracer의 인지적, 신체적, 웰니스 효과를 살펴보세요.",linkText:"효과 살펴보기"},{title:"작동 원리",description:"Ultiracer를 구동하는 하드웨어, 소프트웨어, 경험에 대해 알아보세요.",linkText:"원리 보기"}]},cta:{title:"뉴로사이클리언에 참여할 준비가 되셨나요?",subtitle:"오늘 뇌-신체 균형 트레이닝 여정을 시작하세요.",primaryButton:"지금 시작하기"}},blog:{hero:{badge:"곧 출시",title:"블로그",subtitle:"RDT 커뮤니티의 이야기, 업데이트, 인사이트. 곧 출시됩니다."},posts:[{category:"커뮤니티",title:"뉴로사이클리언 커뮤니티에 오신 것을 환영합니다",date:"곧 출시",excerpt:"균형 사이클링의 과학을 통해 두뇌와 신체를 훈련하는 성장하는 라이더 커뮤니티를 만나보세요."},{category:"과학",title:"뇌-신체 균형 이해하기",date:"곧 출시",excerpt:"사이클링 중 능동적인 조향과 좌우 이동이 어떻게 인지 기능과 조정력을 향상시킬 수 있는지 알아보세요."},{category:"제품",title:"새로운 소식: 플랫폼 업데이트",date:"곧 출시",excerpt:"RDT 트레이닝 플랫폼의 최신 기능과 개선 사항을 살펴보세요."}],comingSoonTag:"곧 출시",readMore:"자세히 보기",newsletter:{title:"소식 받기",subtitle:"새 글이 게시되면 가장 먼저 알려드립니다.",placeholder:"이메일을 입력하세요",button:"알림 받기"}},dashboard:{common:{layout:{nav:{dashboard:"대시보드",sessions:"세션",schedule:"스케줄",leaderboard:"리더보드",platformAnalytics:"플랫폼 분석",facilityAnalytics:"시설 분석",neurocycleansAnalytics:"뉴로사이클린 분석",myAnalytics:"내 분석",guidance:"가이드",users:"사용자",kiosks:"키오스크",facilities:"시설",admin:"관리자"},footer:{copyright:"RealDesignTech.
